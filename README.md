## Controlling sizes of images in CSS
### You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

## Centering images Using Css
### By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block. Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:

* On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.

* On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

## Background Images (backgroung-image)
### The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box
